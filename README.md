📄 README - Day 9 & 10

🔍 Topics Covered: Basic to Advanced Lookups in Excel
🔹 1. VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup):
Purpose: Searches for a value in the first column of a range and returns a value in the same row from another column.

Syntax:
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

Use Case: Finding a price of a product by product name.

Limitation: Can only look right of the lookup column.

🔹 2. HLOOKUP (Horizontal Lookup):
Purpose: Searches for a value in the first row and returns a value in the same column from a specified row.

Syntax:
=HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])

Use Case: Fetching yearly data where headers are in rows.

Limitation: Can only look down from the first row.

🔹 3. INDEX + MATCH (Advanced Lookup):
Purpose: A powerful combo to perform both vertical and horizontal lookups without direction limitations.

Syntax:
=INDEX(return_range, MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_range, 0))

Use Case: Getting a salary of an employee using employee name.

Advantage: More flexible than VLOOKUP and works with data to the left or above.

🔹 4. XLOOKUP (Modern Excel - Best Option):
Purpose: The most advanced and flexible lookup function replacing VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP.

Syntax:
=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])

Use Case: Any lookup—right, left, up, down—with more control.

Advantage: Handles errors, searches in both directions, and returns arrays.

🔹 5. LOOKUP (Legacy Function):
Purpose: Searches for a value in a vector or array and returns a value from the same position in another vector.

-Syntax:
=LOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_vector, result_vector)

Use Case: Basic lookups when data is sorted.

💡 Summary:
