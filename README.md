THIS IS DAY-1

# README - Day 1: Basic Topics in Excel

## Introduction
This document summarizes the key concepts and techniques learned on Day 1 of exploring Excel for data analysis. The focus was on understanding essential operations, using shortcuts, navigating efficiently, and performing basic data manipulations.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Shortcuts for Making Selections**
- Learned how to quickly select cells, rows, columns, and ranges using keyboard shortcuts.

### 2. **Frequently Used Shortcuts**
- Mastered commonly used shortcuts like `Ctrl + C` (Copy), `Ctrl + V` (Paste), and `Ctrl + Z` (Undo).

### 3. **Navigating in Cells**
- Efficiently moved across cells using arrow keys, `Ctrl + Arrow` to jump, and `Ctrl + Home` to return to the top-left corner.

### 4. **Paste Special & Shortcut Keys**
- Explored the `Paste Special` feature to apply operations like value-only pasting, formatting, or formulas.

### 5. **Fitness Progress**
- Created sample data to practice basic functions and visualize progress using charts.

### 6. **Merge**
- Merged multiple cells using `Merge & Center` for creating clear and well-structured headings.

### 7. **Wrap Text**
- Applied the `Wrap Text` feature to fit long content within cells without overflowing into adjacent cells.

### 8. **Number Format**
- Adjusted number formatting using currency, percentages, and custom formats.

### 9. **Insert and Delete**
- Practiced inserting and deleting rows, columns, and individual cells.

### 10. **AutoSum and Fill Basic**
- Used `AutoSum` for quickly summing ranges and applied `Fill Handle` to copy formulas efficiently.

### 11. **Flash Fill**
- Learned how to use Flash Fill for pattern-based data entry automation.

### 12. **Fill Series**
- Generated sequential data using Fill Series for dates, numbers, and custom lists.

### 13. **Operators**
- Applied arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and logical operators (`=`, `>`, `<`) in formulas.

### 14. **Calculation Operators**
- Combined multiple operations using `BODMAS` and nested functions.

### 15. **Cell Reference**
- Worked with relative, absolute, and mixed cell references to build dynamic formulas.

## Practical Application
Each topic was reinforced through hands-on practice, using sample datasets and exercises. By applying formulas, formatting, and data manipulation techniques, a strong foundational understanding of Excel was achieved.

## Conclusion
Day 1 provided a solid introduction to Excel's essential functionalities. The next steps involve exploring intermediate concepts like conditional formatting, functions, charts, and data analysis tools.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

Today, I explored two powerful features in Excel:

### ðŸŽ¨ Conditional Formatting
- Learned how to highlight cells based on specific rules.
- Used color scales, icon sets, and data bars to visualize trends.
- Applied custom formulas to format rows dynamically.
- Example use-cases:
  - Highlighting high/low values.
  - Visual cues for deadlines or targets.
  - Detecting duplicates instantly.

### âœ… Data Validation
- Set rules to control what users can enter into a cell.
- Created dropdown lists for cleaner data entry.
- Applied number, date, and custom validation rules.
- Displayed input messages and error alerts for guidance.

- ðŸ“„ README - Day 8
ðŸ“… Date: (7/04/25)
âœ… Topics Covered:
- Sort â€“ Learned how to sort data alphabetically, numerically, and by custom order to improve data visibility.

- Column Sort â€“ Practiced sorting based on specific columns while keeping data integrity intact.

- Filter â€“ Applied filters to display only relevant data, making large datasets easier to analyze.

- Group & Ungroup â€“ Explored how to group rows/columns for better structure and ungroup them when needed.

- Protect Cell or Range â€“ Secured specific cells or ranges to prevent unwanted editing by others.

- Protect Sheet â€“ Applied protection to the entire worksheet while allowing some editable areas.

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:
Efficient data organization saves time and reduces errors.

Protection features are essential in collaborative environments to maintain data accuracy and control.
