# README - Day 1: Basic Topics in Excel

## Introduction
This document summarizes the key concepts and techniques learned on Day 1 of exploring Excel for data analysis. The focus was on understanding essential operations, using shortcuts, navigating efficiently, and performing basic data manipulations.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Shortcuts for Making Selections**
- Learned how to quickly select cells, rows, columns, and ranges using keyboard shortcuts.

### 2. **Frequently Used Shortcuts**
- Mastered commonly used shortcuts like `Ctrl + C` (Copy), `Ctrl + V` (Paste), and `Ctrl + Z` (Undo).

### 3. **Navigating in Cells**
- Efficiently moved across cells using arrow keys, `Ctrl + Arrow` to jump, and `Ctrl + Home` to return to the top-left corner.

### 4. **Paste Special & Shortcut Keys**
- Explored the `Paste Special` feature to apply operations like value-only pasting, formatting, or formulas.

### 5. **Fitness Progress**
- Created sample data to practice basic functions and visualize progress using charts.

### 6. **Merge**
- Merged multiple cells using `Merge & Center` for creating clear and well-structured headings.

### 7. **Wrap Text**
- Applied the `Wrap Text` feature to fit long content within cells without overflowing into adjacent cells.

### 8. **Number Format**
- Adjusted number formatting using currency, percentages, and custom formats.

### 9. **Insert and Delete**
- Practiced inserting and deleting rows, columns, and individual cells.

### 10. **AutoSum and Fill Basic**
- Used `AutoSum` for quickly summing ranges and applied `Fill Handle` to copy formulas efficiently.

### 11. **Flash Fill**
- Learned how to use Flash Fill for pattern-based data entry automation.

### 12. **Fill Series**
- Generated sequential data using Fill Series for dates, numbers, and custom lists.

### 13. **Operators**
- Applied arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and logical operators (`=`, `>`, `<`) in formulas.

### 14. **Calculation Operators**
- Combined multiple operations using `BODMAS` and nested functions.

### 15. **Cell Reference**
- Worked with relative, absolute, and mixed cell references to build dynamic formulas.

## Practical Application
Each topic was reinforced through hands-on practice, using sample datasets and exercises. By applying formulas, formatting, and data manipulation techniques, a strong foundational understanding of Excel was achieved.

## Conclusion
Day 1 provided a solid introduction to Excel's essential functionalities. The next steps involve exploring intermediate concepts like conditional formatting, functions, charts, and data analysis tools.
